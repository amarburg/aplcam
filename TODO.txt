- Why is Ceres residual different from reprojection error?

- Work out the video versus post-processed dichotomoy

- Create a Hierarchy of DetectionSource -> DetectionDb
  so a detection source is basically a source of "frames" of Detections which wraps around a
  VideoCapture.   add a "isFixedSize()" flag
  Then various splitters can use different strategies depending on whether it's fixed size
  (e.g. random) or not (e.g. interval?)
  DetectionDb can then be generate-on-demand (or be preseeded)

- Store meta-information about the video source in the db

- Pass OpenCV termination criteria to Ceres in AngularPolynomial
